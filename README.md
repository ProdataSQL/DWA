# DWA - Data Warehouse Automation Framework (Fabric Edition)

## Welcome

Welcome to the Prodata Fabric Data Warehouse Automation Framework. DWA is a metadata automation framework for data warehousing and data engineering. We have been developing and improving this framework for 15 years, and it is now available as open source for you to try.

## Overview

The DWA framework supports the entire enterprise data warehouse lifecycle (and other data engineering projects) by reducing data engineering pipelines and tasks to metadata and enforcing common enterprise features such as logging, lineage, and error handling, along with orchestration and a flexible template library.

## Getting Started and Documentation

You can browse this GitHub repository to use some of the templates for ideas on your project.

## Engaging with Prodata for a Quick Start

If you want to try the framework in your Fabric environment, Prodata offers a Fabric Data Warehouse Quick Start. This is a 2–3 week engagement to install the framework, create a sample proof of concept using your actual data, and provide a walkthrough and training to accelerate your adoption of Fabric.
